By writing $PA = LU$, it seems like you *first* decide on the row-reordering of $A$, and *then* compute the LU factorization of $PA$.  But how do you know the proper row-reordering *before* you do elimination?  In fact, this is an illusion: the computer figures out the row-reordering as it goes along (partial pivoting as described above), but it then cleverly works backwards to figure out what reordering it *should* have done in the beginning!"
