    "\n",
    "One of the first things that most students learn about in linear algebra is the [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant) of a matrix.  Lots of useful formulas for 2×2 and 3×3 matrices can be expressed in terms of determinants, and determinants played a central role in linear algebra 100 years ago when most matrices were tiny.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, determinants are much less useful as a practical tool, although they still occasionally show up. Determinant-related formulas are also useful in proving theorems in linear algebra.   The basic computational problem, however, is that the determinant formulas don't scale — for a big matrix, there is almost always a better way of computing something than using explicit determinants, cofactors, [Cramer's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer's_rule), and other tricks useful for small matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, it is important to know what determinants are, and their basic properties.  In 18.06, we mainly use determinants as a *conceptual* tool to help us understand eigenvalues via the [characteristic polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_polynomial) — although, again, this is not a practical *computational* tool for eigenvalues, which are nowadays computed by very different methods."

    "\n",
    "Ignoring formulas (e.g. Cramer's rule, a formula for $A^{-1}$ — see Strang, section 5.3) that are mainly useful for tiny matrices, here are some examples of real usages of determinants **even for large matrices**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understanding **eigenvalues**: determinants will turn eigenvalues into polynomial roots, and since we know about polynomial roots, that tells us a lot about eigenvalues.  (This is *not* how eigenvalues are *computed* in practice, however!)\n",
    "\n",
    " - There is also something called a [nonlinear eigenproblem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_eigenproblem), arising in many science and engineering problems, in which the determinant plays a basic conceptual role.  Again, however, computational methods typically avoid computing determinants explicitly except for tiny matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Proofs: Determinants show up in a lot of proofs in matrix theory, because they reduce matrices to numbers that have nice properties and are easy to reason about.  One also often sees things like the [adjugate matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjugate_matrix) and the [Cayley–Hamilton theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Hamilton_theorem), both related to determinants.\n",
    "\n",
    " - That is, we often use determinants to help use understand and derive things in linear algebra, even if the final result doesn't require us to *compute* the determinant for any practical purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Jacobian factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant): in multivariable calculus, a factor of $|\\det J|$ arises when you perform a *change of variables* in integration, where $J$ is a Jacobian matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The reason a determinant arises here is that, more generally, **det(A) is the volume of a parallelepiped** (\"box\") whose edges are given by the columns of $A$.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Integration may sound like something that only happens in a few dimensions (= tiny matrices J), but extremely high dimensional (even infinite-dimensional) integrals appear in statistics, quantum field theory, bioinformatics, and other fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "* High-dimensional [Gaussian integrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integral) often arise in **statistics** and related areas of science (e.g. [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_integrals_in_quantum_field_theory)), and the inverse of the square root of a determinant appears in the answer.  Often, one wants the logarithm of the result, in which case what arises is the **log determinant** $\\log \\det A$, an important matrix function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is no doubt an incomplete list.  Nevertheless, although determinants are a much more marginal topic in modern linear algebra than they were in the 19th century, they have hardly disappeared."
