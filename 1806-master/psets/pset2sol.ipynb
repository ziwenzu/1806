    "Note about pedagogical style: Your professor tends to use the technique of \"foreshadowing.\"  This means that you may see a notion in the homework that we believe you are ready to attack at this point in the class,  but the bigger picture emerges later. It is well known that most students learn best this way.  Of course if you start googling around, you can see the bigger picture earlier, at least with some other author's notation or point of view.  I can't and wouldn't stop you, but rest assured you will see concepts over and over again in expanding waves in this class. <br> <br>\n",
    "If you need to know where we are heading, I am planning to cover all of the results (but not the methods in) Strang's chapters 2 and 3 by leading up to the SVD (singular value decomposition) without any mention of pivot variables, free variables, or eigenvalues.  This means you are less likely to understand how to hand compute the various concepts, and more likely to understand them conceptually.  This gives us time to also show you some applications.  It is indeed an experiment, which is why I welcome feedback, positive and negative, during my many, office hours, but I honestly feel in my heart that I am providing a valuable approach.\n",

This is not going to be the style of class where you find a similar problem in the lecture notes and just repeat.  You may have to reach back into the 18.02 prerequisites for this class.  You may learn a lot by working with other students in the class.  There is a lot to be learned  [at the math learning center](https://math.mit.edu/learningcenter/), in recitations, during the TAs office hours, and my numerous office hours.  No promises that 18.06 is easy, only that you will learn a lot!\n",
