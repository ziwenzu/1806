Since the determinant of this matrix is $-1$ and the identity is $1$, we require an odd number of row exchanges by parity. Note that the $1$ in each row is off-diagonal, thus each row needs to be exchanged with another. This reasoning implies that one row exchange is not sufficient to get the identity. Therefore we need at least $3$ row exchanges. If we flip rows $3$ and $4$, then rows $2$ and $3$, then rows $1$ and $2$, this gives the identity. Thus three is the minimal number of row exchanges."
