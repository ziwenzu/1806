    "(1b) A matrix $P$ is a projection matrix if it is symmetric and $P^2=P$. We showed in part (a) that the square of a symmetric matrix is also symmetric. We also need to show that $(P^2)^2 = P^2$. But since $P$ is a projection, both sides of this equality are $P$. So $P^2$ is also a projection matrix.\n",

    "(1c) Suppose every entry of a matrix $A$ is positive. Every entry of $A^2$ is obtained by taking the dot product of a column and row of $A$. Since every entry of $A$ is positive, each entry of $A^2$ is obtained by taking sums and products of positive numbers. And so every entry of $A^2$ will be positive. \n",

    "(1d) Suppose $A$ is positive definite. Then all of the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $A$ are real and positive. The eigenvalues of $A^2$ are $\\lambda^2$ which are also necessarily positive. And so $A^2$ is positive definite.\n",

    "(1e) A matrix $A$ is a positive Markov matrix precisely when all its entries are positive and $\\mathbf{1} A=\\mathbf{1}$, where $\\mathbf{1}$ denotes the all ones row vector of the appropriate size. We have shown that the square of a matrix with only positive entries has only positive entries. As $\\mathbf{1} A^2=(\\mathbf{1} A) A=\\mathbf{1} A=\\mathbf{1}$, we conclude that the square of a positive  Markov matrix is a positive Markov matrix.\n",
