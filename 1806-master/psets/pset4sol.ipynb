    "A) As $A$ has $2$ positive singular values, we conclude that $A$ is of rank $2$ and therefore that $\\text{col}(A)$ is the space of dimension $2$ spanned by the first two columns of $U$. Such a space is simply a plane through the origin in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and so exhibiting a single vector $n \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ that is orthogonal to $\\text{col}(A)$ suffices to describe $\\text{col}(A)$. As $U$ is an orthogonal matrix, the third column of $U$ is orthogonal to the space spanned by the first two columns, and so, since $(4,-2,1)$ is parrallel to the third column of $U$, $n=(4,-2,1)$ is normal to $\\text{col}(A)$.

As $\\text{null}(A^{\\intercal})$ is spanned by the third column of $U$, we have that $c_1 A_1+ c_2 A_2 + c_3 A_3 =0$ precisely when $(c_1,c_2,c_3)=\\alpha(4,-2,1)$ for some $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n",

    "A)False. Consider a matrix $A$ with (compact) SVD $U_1 \\Sigma_r V_1^{\\intercal}$. Its columns are dependent precisely when $\\text{null}(A)$ is non-trivial (we say $\\text{null}(A)$ is non-trivial when it contains at least one vector other than the zero vector). Similarly, the rows of $A$ are dependent precisely when $\\text{null}(A^{\\intercal})$ is non-trivial. If $A$ is $m \\times n$ and has rank $r$, then $\\text{null}(A)$ is non-trivial precisely when $r<n$ and $\\text{null}(A^{\\intercal})$ is non-trivial precisely when $r<m$. Let $A$ be an $m \\times n$ matrix of rank $r$ in which $m=r$ an $n=r+1$ (for example, take the $m \\times m$ identity matrix and glue a column of all zeros onto it). Then the columns of this matrix will be dependent as $r<n$ but the rows are independent as $r=m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "B)False. Let $u,v$ denote two linearly independent unit vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, for example $u=(1,0)$ and $v=(0,1)$, and consider that matrix $A=uv^{\\intercal}$. $A$ is of rank $1$ so it will have a (compact) SVD $U_1 \\Sigma_1 V_1^{\\intercal}$ where $\\Sigma_1$ is the $1 \\times 1$ identity matrix (the single entry is $1$) and $U_1$ and $V_1$ are $2 \\times 1$ matrices where $U_1$ consists of the entries of $u$ and $V_1$ consists of the entries of $v$. The column space of $A$ is the space spanned by $u$ but the rowspace of $A$ is the space spanned by $v$. As $u$ and $v$ are linearly independent, these spaces are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "C)True. If $A$ has rank $r$, then both the column space of $A$ and the rowspace of $A$ have dimension $r$. This follows from the fact that, if $A$ has (compact) SVD $U_1 \\Sigma_r V_1^{\\intercal}$ a basis of the column space of $A$ is given by the columns of $U_1$ and a basis of the rowspace of $A$ is given by the columns of $V_1$. As $U_1$ and $V_1$ both have $r$ columns, we conclude that these two spaces both have dimension $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "D)False. Let $A$ be an $m \\times n$ matrix of rank $r$ for which $r<n$, (the example used in the above solution to part (A) is such a matrix), then $A$ will have a (compact) SVD $U_1 \\Sigma_r V_1^{\\intercal}$. As noted above, the columns of $U_1$ form a basis of the column space of $A$ and so the column space of $A$ must be of dimension $r$. However, $A$ has $n>r$ columns, and so the columns of $A$ cannot be a basis of the column space of $A$, as they cannot be linearly independent (though, of course, the columns of any matrix $A$ do span the column space of $A$, by definition)."
