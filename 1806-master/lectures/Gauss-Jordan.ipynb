    "* Inverse matrices are **almost never computed** in \"serious\" numerical calculations.  Whenever you see $A^{-1} B$ (or $A^{-1} b$), when you go to *implement* it on a computer you should *read* $A^{-1} B$ as \"solve $AX = B$ by some method.\" e.g. solve it by `A \\ B` or by first computing the LU factorization of $A$ and then using it to solve $AX = B$.\n",

For example, many large matrices in practice are [sparse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) (mostly zero), and often for sparse matrices you can arrange for $L$ and $U$ to be sparse too.  Sparse matrices are much more efficient to work with than general \"dense\" matrices because you don't have to multiply (or even store) the zeros. Even if $A$ is sparse, however, $A^{-1}$ is usually non-sparse, so you lose the special efficiency of sparsity if you compute the inverse matrix.  \n",
